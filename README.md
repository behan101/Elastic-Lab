# Elastic-Lab

## Objective

The goal of this lab was to setup a virtual network using Kali Linux, Virtual Box, and utilize Elastic (SIEM) to detect and respond to potential threats. After intergrating Elastic, I was able to query search for specific threats and create alerts. I allowed the SIEM to ingest data and visualize it for stakeholders.

### Skills Learned

- Kali Linux: Constructed a vitural network using Kali Linux. Various commands were used to identify network connections such as ifconfig and nmap.
- Virtual Machine: By using a virtual machine, I was able to create a safe environment for testing and configuring networks. Also it allowed me to ethically and safely use port scanning tools such as nmap.
- Port Scanning
- Query Search by threat identifiers.
- Alert/Rule creation.
- SIEM integration.

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Virtual Box
- Elastic (SIEM)
- Nmap
